                <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
                <p>Python can be used for several different purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On a server to create web applications.</li>
                    <li>Alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                    <li>To connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                    <li>To handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                    <li>For rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</p>
                <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.</p>
                <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
                <code>
                    if 5 > 2:
                        print("Five is greater than two!")
                </code>
                <p>Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:</p>
                <code>
                    #This is a comment.
                    print("Hello, World!")
                </code>
